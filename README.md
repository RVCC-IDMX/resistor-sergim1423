# Resistor
# This is the resister calculator
## Click on any band and find out the value
### How it works is by taking the click value and manipulating it 
### into the resistor value calculator to get the desired outcome
### so if red is click, we would get the value of red and correspond that
### with a number and then calculate using the rest of the bands.
